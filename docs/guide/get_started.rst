Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can run tests in all supported Python versions using ``tox``. By default,
it will run all of the unit tests, linters and coverage. Note that this requires that you have all supported
versions of Python installed, otherwise you must pass ``-e``.

.. code-block:: sh

    $ tox
    $ tox -e py37,py38
